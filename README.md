# Real-Time Object Detection using TensorFlow

This project implements a real-time object detection system using the TensorFlow Object Detection API, a powerful framework built on top of TensorFlow. The system is designed to detect and classify multiple objects within a live video stream captured from a webcam or video feed in real-time.

The core objective of this project is to leverage pre-trained deep learning models (like SSD MobileNet, Faster R-CNN, or YOLO variants) to accurately identify and localize objects within the video frames. This detection pipeline provides bounding boxes, class labels, and confidence scores for each detected object, enabling real-world applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics, and assistive technologies.

Key Features:
Real-time detection with webcam/video input

Bounding box visualization with class labels and confidence scores

Support for multiple object categories

Efficient performance on CPU or GPU

Modular, customizable, and scalable architecture
